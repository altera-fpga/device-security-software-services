     * Looks for cached URL that ends with the same filename as requested original URL. If such URL exists returns
     * cached CRL associated with it, if not, throws BKPRuntimeException.
     * <br>
     * <br>This method enables to use different distribution point than intel production (tsci.intel.com),
     * because certificates issued by FPGA device contain hardcoded URLs to L0 and L1 CRLs on intel production DP.
     * <br>
     * <br> For example firmware certificate from Agilex device contains following URL to L1 CRL:
     * <br>- <a href="https://tsci.intel.com/content/IPCS/crls/IPCS_agilex_L1.crl">...</a>
     * <br>
     * <br>If BKPS is configured to use custom DP, L1 CRL must also be from this custom DP,
     * otherwise it would be impossible to verify that CRL was signed by trusted issuer.
     * <br>
     * <br>Assumption is that if customer wants to use custom DP, it must contain L0 and L1 CRLs with
     * following filenames:
     * <br> - for L0: IPCS_{@literal <familyNameInLowercase>}.crl
     * <br> - for L1: IPCS_{@literal <familyNameInLowercase>}_L1.crl
